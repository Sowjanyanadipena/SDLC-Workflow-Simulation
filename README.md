# SDLC Workflow Simulation
## Overview
This project simulates the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using a console-based Python application. It allows users to go through all phases: Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
## Features
- Enter project requirements
- Add system design details
- Simulate development phase
- Perform testing and log bugs
- Deploy the project
- Record maintenance updates
- View overall project status
## Requirements
- Python 3
## How to Run
1. Copy the full Python code into Google Colab or any Python IDE
2. Run the script
3. Follow the menu options to simulate each SDLC phase
## Workflow
1. Requirements: Collect project requirements
2. Design: Define system architecture or design
3. Development: Implement features based on design
4. Testing: Log bugs and testing results
5. Deployment: Deploy the final product
6. Maintenance: Add updates and fixes post-deployment
## Outputs
- Interactive SDLC menu
- Detailed status of each SDLC phase
## Future Enhancements
- Role-based access for different SDLC stages
- Persistent storage in CSV or database
- Reports and analytics for SDLC timeline
- Web-based UI for better user experience
